# Python Theme Switcher

## Why?
This is just a small project to force myself to try out Python.
For now, I'm basically just calling bash commands via python, but I'll clean it up later.

I made this as an alternative to tools like lxappearance and nwg-look because I like changing my desktop appearance rather frequently.

## Basic Usage
`python main.py themes/<theme-name>.json`

- Theme files are just a list of relevant theme tag names in json format.
- The theme templates that exist currently are my own and depend on having the correct icon/theme/sound packs already installed.
